## About me
My name is David Bednárek, I am from Czech Republic and I am currently a student at VŠB-TUO in Ostrava where I study computer science. At the end of my study I expect to be an advanced programmer in low level languages.

After starting university I began to love low level programming and I can see myself doing it more often in the future.

My hobbies consist of playing videogames, programming and watching movies.

I often work on projects alone with eventual help from friends.
