## My personally favourite programming projects
### [JC-server](https://github.com/jantar1154/JC-server)
This is a program acting as a server for my upcoming chatting app. It is implemented entirely in Rust programming language and is still in the early stages of development. I chose to divide this project into two parts (server and client) so that a 3rd party client can be created.

### [PISHQOR](https://github.com/jantar1154/PISHQOR)
This little web-based Tic Tac Toe game I made while very simple in nature, I enjoyed developing it and I am fond of the idea and see a lot of potential in it.
